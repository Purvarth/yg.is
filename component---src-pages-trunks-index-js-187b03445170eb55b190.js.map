What is a better alternative to family trees that is more concerned with breadth of relations, rather than their depths?\"/>\n           <Paragraph paragraphTitle=\"Identifying Pain-Points of the Tree Model\" \n                    paragraphBody=\"I interviewed classmates in my Cultural Anthropology course about the same assignment assignment that inspired my inquiry into ancestral data visualization.

When the ancestor has many siblings, the chart is primarily horizontal. On the other hand, when the ancestor has many descendants, the chart is primarily vertical. This variability is not accounted for when displaying charts in smaller viewport sizes, such as on a mobile screen. Even when viewed on a large screen, the window needs to scroll both vertically and horizontally, leading to poor user experience.

In thinking about tree chart models, it is easy to make a depth first analysis, but for family trees, I would argue that a breadth search approach is better, because it allows for more information about distant relatives. As one can see in the diagram, A, B, C and D are unaccounted for. The ideal system would account for all collateral ancestral relations. The challenge then lies in finding a visualization methodology that analyses and displays both the depth and the breadth of genealogical data.\"/>\n           <Paragraph paragraphTitle=\"Applying Graph Theory\" \n                    paragraphBody=\"In order to better understand my task, I turned to research on graph theory, namely the concept of a directed acyclic graph. A directed acyclic graph is a finite graph with no cycle, which means that there is a finite amount of vertices and edges, which can never loop. In the context of family trees, this means that no one can become their own ancestor. Therefore, I reframed family trees as a directed acyclic graphs, with a vertex for each family member and an edge for each parent-child relationship.\"/>\n          </div>\n          <div id=\"p3\">\n          <Phase phaseTitle=\"Making the Trunk Model Reality\"/>\n          <Paragraph paragraphTitle=\"JSON Structure\" \n                    paragraphBody=\"The first step in redefining genealogical data visualization is translating from traditional family tree models into something a computer can easily comprehend. I used the algorithm of a directed acyclic graph to determine vertices and edges by matching up parents and common children in a JSON file through name-value pairs.
