        <h3 class="case__description-title">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">Created at the BitCamp hackathon in 36 hours, MadLads is a mobile web app reinvention of the famous phrasal template word game called Mad Libs, in which a player is prompted to fill in blanks to create a custom story. We took the same concept and incorporated machine learning and image recognition into the process of choosing words. In order to pick a word for the fill-in-the-blank, the user takes a photo of an object, which is then recognized and inputted into a list. After choosing up to five words, the user is presented with the crafted story, often humorous. The user then has a choice to try again for a different story with different words. <em class="u-bold">The project received the "Best First Time Hack" award at the hackathon.</p></em>

            <h3 class="case__callout-title">Design Challenge</h3>
            <p class="case__callout-body">Develop a mobile app that has a simple user flow to reflect a game of Mad Libs in only 36 hours. Work with machine learning libraries to develop an image recognition system.
            </p>

        <h3 class="case__description-title">Inspiration</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">Inspired by the ml5.js machine learning library and Google's emoji scavenger hunt, Amanda Yeh and I decided to create a similar game that incorporated train models to create an entertaining experience for the user. This is the first time we dip our toes in the vast ocean of possibility that comes with machine learning. The thematic inspiration came from the game Mad Libs, a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the – often comical or nonsensical – story aloud.</p>

        <h3 class="case__description-title">Machine Learning Methodology</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">We used ml5.js, a pre-trained, web-friendly machine learning library based on Tensorflow that allowed us to create web applications that use machine learning processes on the web. We integrated the image recognition portion of the library with a live feed and used p5 and vanilla Javascript to create an interactive, entertaining experience in the form of an AI-assisted Mad Libs game.</p>

        <h3 class="case__description-title">User Flow</h3>
 <p class="case__description-body">We started with developing user flows for the app, which were fairly simple. </p>

        <h3 class="case__description-title">Iterative Evolution of the Interface</h3>
 <p class="case__description-body">I created simple sketches to brainstorm different aspects of the interface. </p>

        <h3 class="case__description-title">Onboarding Experience</h3>
 <p class="case__description-body">We included some image recognition aspects on the start page in order to intrigue the user and give them a summary of how the prime feature functions.</p>


        <h3 class="case__description-title">Challenges & Accomplishments</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">There was a lot of trouble when it came to incorporating an environment-facing camera for mobile. However, in the end, we solved the issue by linking Google Chrome Dev Tools to our phones and learned that we had a simple syntax error in the createCapture object. In addition, the text-to-speech synthesis had a few glitches involving repeating strings of sentences, but it was fixed. There were also some tweaks required to adjust the sensitivity of the image recognition. We are proud of the smoothly functioning image recognition and phrasal template system, and our user experience design. We paid close attention to giving the user helpful feedback and options, such as allowing them to retry to capture the word and providing them with a little counter to keep in mind how many images they have left to take. Another example of user experience that we are proud of is our consistent style guides and interactive onboarding in the first slide, where the user can start trying out the image recognition system from the get-go.</p>

        <h3 class="case__description-title">Awards Received</h3>


        <h3 class="case__description-title">Future Developments</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">We would like to rewrite a lot of the code base, because much of it was done in a hurry without proper programming conventions. This should better our site’s performance. Another idea is to create a desktop version of the site that either redirects one to the mobile version or is a game in its own right. Re-working the UI is a real possibility after we observed and recorded the challenges the users experienced during the judging session.</p>
