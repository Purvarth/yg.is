        <h3 class="case__description-title">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">Throughout the web, I have encountered that museum sites all follow the same general structure: monochrome, high-contrast palettes to highlight the diversity of color in the artworks. The structural similarities throughout all museum sites intrigued me, so I chose to conduct an heuristic analysis of the museum web experience and redesigned the notoriously outdated website of the American Visionary Art Museum according to my findings.</p>

        <h3 class="case__description-title"> Background</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">The American Visionary Art Museum is a museum in Baltimore, MD that specializes in the preservation and display of outsider art, or art that is created by self-taught artists without an academic background in fine arts. Their exhibitions are curated by guest curators and are fairly eclectic. The focus on accessibility of the art world pushed by the museum is not reflected in their current branding, especially not their design. The <a class="u-sky">original website</a> of the American Visionary Art Museum harbors a plethora of accessibility, performance and branding issues that stem from a design that was built for Netscape and has not changed in a very long time as a result. In order to redesign its information architecture, I set out to conduct a lot of research, including creating user personas, conducting a heuristic evaluation and setting up priority guides before creating wireframes. As of 2019, the original website can still be found here, and it is a sight to behold.
