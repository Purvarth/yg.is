        <h3 class="case__description-title"> Background</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">Museums are in a funny spot. Some are enjoying record attendance as visitors flock to show-stopping exhibitions. Yet, other institutions feel stuck: they haven’t quite figured out how to—or don’t care to—tap into these audiences, are trapped behind baggage of tradition, and so on. Still, all of them are competing for the same eyeballs... and new-comers such as pop-up experiences are elbowing in and, in some cases, eating their lunch. Many institutions have embraced digital media as a “way in” for audiences old and new, as a way to unlock and interpret their collections, or as a draw in and of itself. Some museums also see digital as a way to finally expand their collection, stories, and mission out into the larger world—and as such, a way to fundamentally change the perception and maybe even the defini- tion of “museum.” But what separates a meaningful, cultural experience from a strictly-for-the-likes Instagram museum?
