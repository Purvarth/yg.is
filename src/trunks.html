        <h3 class="case__description-title">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">The tree model of genealogical data visualization is inherently flawed. Though
            user interviews, I identified the main issues faced by those analyzing family trees. After identifying the
            main issues, I set out to develop a graceful and user-centered solution. Trunks is the result of my mission.
            Through research about graph theory and with the use of the d3.js JavaScript library, I designed an
            open-source web application that visualizes familial bonds in the form of a sunburst chart, which resembles
            a chopped down trunk. </p>

            <h3 class="case__callout-title">Design Challenge</h3>
            <p class="case__callout-body">Develop a simple visualization method for genealogical data that presents
                ancestral relations concisely, thoroughly and in a usable manner.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="case__description-title">User Research</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">In order to optimize the visualization of familial relations, I set out to
            research and identify common shortcomings of the traditional tree model. I chose to interview classmates in
            my Cultural Anthropology course about a recent assignment that involved researching family trees and
            assessed their experience with deriving information from them. I interviewed 5 people for 15 minutes each
            and asked each interviewee to design the perfect family tree at the end of our conversation. I recorded my
            findings and drew conclusions at the end of the user interviews.</p>

        <h3 class="case__description-title">Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">Three common issues kept being brought up: lack of scalability, visual
            verbosity and limited scope, with focus primarily skewed towards one ancestral branch. Below are the three
            main issues with brief explanations of each one.

                <p class="case__callout-body">Lack of Scalability
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="case__problems--item">

                <p class="case__callout-body">Limited Scope
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="case__description-body"> <em class="case__description--subhead">Lack of Scalability</em> The length
            and width of family trees are unpredictable and
            vary based on the data being mapped. When the ancestor has many siblings, the chart is primarily horizontal.
            On the other hand, when the ancestor has many descendants, the chart is primarily vertical. This variability
            is not accounted for when displaying charts in smaller viewport sizes, such as on a mobile screen. Even when
            viewed on a large screen, the window needs to scroll both vertically and horizontally, leading to poor user
            experience. Therefore, the tree model is outdated, not scalable or responsive and unsuited for the modern,
            digital user.
        </p>
        <p class="case__description-body"> <em class="case__description--subhead">Visual Density</em> The horizontally
            and vertically variable design does not give a concise summary of data to the user at first glance.
            Hierarchy is not effectively communicated and requires more thinking of the user’s part. Usable design must
            be effortless to comprehend.
        </p>
        <p class="case__description-body"> <em class="case__description--subhead">Limited Scope</em> Because of the
            dimensional limitations of the tree model, the chart can only display one
            branch at a time, resulting in a skewed chart. A simple flaw of design, unilaterality, results in the
            omission of data, which is intellectually dishonest and defeats the purpose of displaying data in the first
            place.

                <p class=" case__description-body">All these commonly encountered issues can be encompassed by
                    the conflict between Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search. In
                    thinking about tree chart models, it is easy to make a depth first analysis, but for family trees, I
                    would argue that a breadth search
                    approach is better, because it allows for more information about distant relatives. As one can see
                    in
                    the diagram, A, B, C and D are unaccounted for. The ideal system would account for all collateral
                    ancestral relations. The challenge then lies in finding a visualization methodology that analyses
                    and
                    displays
                    both the depth and the breadth of genealogical data.

                <h3 class=" case__description-title--inner">Methodology: Applying Graph Theory</h3>
                <p class=" case__description-body">In order to better
                    understand my task, I turned
                    research on graph
                    theory,
                    namely the concept of a directed acyclic graph. A directed acyclic
                    graph is a
                    finite graph with no cycle,
                    which means that there is a finite amount of vertices and edges they can never loop. In the
                    context of
                    family trees, this means that no one can become their own ancestor, so family trees are acyclic.
                    Therefore,
                    I reframed family trees as directed acyclic graphs, with a vertex for each family member and an
                    edge for
                    each parent-child relationship.

        <h3 class="case__description-title">Methodology: JSON Structure</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">The first step in redefining genealogical data visualization is translating
            from traditional family tree models into something a computer can easily comprehend. I used the algorithm of
            a directed acyclic graph to determine vertices and edges by matching up parents and common children in a
            JSON file through name-value pairs. I then calculated generations by analyzing the structural depth of
            parental relations. Below is an illustration of how the pair structure works in a traditional tree model and
            a JSON file.
