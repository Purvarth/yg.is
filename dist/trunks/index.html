        <h3>Secondary Header</h3>
        <p>Family trees can be seen as directed acyclic graphs, with a vertex for each family member and an edge for each parent-child relationship. No one can become their own ancestor, so family trees are acyclic. Using data fed through an interface or entered manually, one can determine partners by matching up names and children. Generations will be determined by the semantic depth of parental relations. Family trees by nature have always seemed very mathematical to me, almost like fractal trees. One comes from two, comes from four, comes from eight, with certain nuances, like divorces and siblings. This is what I want to focus on.</p>

            <span>I want to create a system that would allow for a beautiful visualization of a familial dynasty, historical, fictional or otherwise. Instead of following a rigid mathematical structure based on fractals, I would like to focus on aberrations in the family that make the fractal-like nature of a family tree imperfect, making it unique.Every one of my friends and their grandma knows that I am going to California for someone’s Thanksgiving. Toodly boody bah, I love Kian so much.</span>
