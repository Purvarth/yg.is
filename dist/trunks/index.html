Hey, curious one! 

I see that you are snooping in my spaghetti code. 

Let me know if you see something wrong by shooting me an email at ygis@mit.edu

        <h3 class="case__description-title">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">The tree model of genealogical data visualization is inherently flawed. Though
            user interviews, I identified the main issues faced by those analyzing family trees. After identifying the
            main issues, I set out to develop a graceful and user-centered solution. Trunks is the result of my mission.
            Through research about graph theory and with the use of the d3.js JavaScript library, I designed an
            open-source web application that visualizes familial bonds in the form of a sunburst chart, which resembles
            a chopped down trunk. </p>

                ancestral relations concisely, thoroughly and in a usable manner.

        <h3 class="case__description-title">User Research</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">In order to optimize the visualization of familial relations, I set out to
            research and identify common shortcomings of the traditional tree model. I chose to interview classmates in
            my Cultural Anthropology course about a recent assignment that involved analyzing family trees. I interviewed 5 people for 15 minutes each and asked each interviewee to design the perfect family tree at the end of our conversation. I recorded my
            findings and drew conclusions at the end of the user interviews.</p>

        <h3 class="case__description-title">Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">Three common issues kept being brought up: lack of scalability, visual
            verbosity and limited scope, with focus primarily skewed towards one ancestral branch. Below are the three
            main issues with brief explanations of each one.
        </p>
        <ul class="case__problems">
            <li class="case__problems--item">
                <h3 class="case__callout-title">Issue 1</h3>
                <p class="case__callout-body">Lack of Scalability
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="case__problems--item">
                <h3 class="case__callout-title">Issue 2</h3>
                <p class="case__callout-body">Visual Density
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="case__problems--item">
                <h3 class="case__callout-title">Issue 3</h3>
                <p class="case__callout-body">Limited Scope
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="case__description-body"> <em class="case__description--subhead">Lack of Scalability</em> The length
            and width of family trees are unpredictable and
            vary based on the data being mapped. When the ancestor has many siblings, the chart is primarily horizontal.
            On the other hand, when the ancestor has many descendants, the chart is primarily vertical. This variability
            is not accounted for when displaying charts in smaller viewport sizes, such as on a mobile screen. Even when
            viewed on a large screen, the window needs to scroll both vertically and horizontally, leading to poor user
            experience. Therefore, the tree model is outdated, not scalable or responsive and thus unsuited for the modern,
            digital user.
        </p>
        <p class="case__description-body"> <em class="case__description--subhead">Visual Density</em> The horizontally
            and vertically variable design does not give a concise summary of data to the user at first glance.
            Hierarchy is not effectively communicated and requires more thinking of the user’s part. Usable design must
            be effortless to comprehend.
        </p>
        <p class="case__description-body"> <em class="case__description--subhead">Limited Scope</em> Because of the
            dimensional limitations of the tree model, the chart can only display one
            branch at a time, resulting in a skewed visual representation. A simple flaw of design, unilaterality, results in the
            omission of data, which is intellectually dishonest and defeats the purpose of displaying data in the first
            place.

                <h3 class=" case__description-title--inner">Trunk Model: Breadth-First Search</h3>
                <p class=" case__description-body">All these commonly encountered issues can be encompassed by
                    the conflict between Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search. In
                    thinking about tree chart models, it is easy to make a depth first analysis, but for family trees, I
                    would argue that a breadth search approach is better, because it allows for more information about distant relatives. As one can see
                    in
                    the diagram, A, B, C and D are unaccounted for. The ideal system would account for all collateral
                    ancestral relations. The challenge then lies in finding a visualization methodology that analyses
                    and
                    displays
                    both the depth and the breadth of genealogical data.

                <h3 class=" case__description-title--inner">Trunk Model: Applying Graph Theory</h3>
                <p class=" case__description-body">In order to better
                    understand my task, I turned to
                    research on graph
                    theory,
                    namely the concept of a directed acyclic graph. A directed acyclic
                    graph is a
                    finite graph with no cycle,
                    which means that there is a finite amount of vertices and edges, which can never loop. In the
                    context of
                    family trees, this means that no one can become their own ancestor.
                    Therefore,
                    I reframed family trees as a directed acyclic graphs, with a vertex for each family member and an
                    edge for
                    each parent-child relationship.

        <h3 class="case__description-title">Trunk Model: JSON Structure</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">The first step in redefining genealogical data visualization is translating
            from traditional family tree models into something a computer can easily comprehend. I used the algorithm of
            a directed acyclic graph to determine vertices and edges by matching up parents and common children in a
            JSON file through name-value pairs. I then calculated generations by analyzing the structural depth of
            parental relations. Below is an illustration of how the pair structure works in a traditional tree model and
            a JSON file.

                <h3 class=" case__description-title--inner">Trunk Model: Design</h3>
                <p class=" case__description-body">Instead of using the branch-system of ancestral relation, I drew inspiration from annual growth rings on tree trunks. The resulting visualization technique expanded multilaterally, rather than just to the left or right. As a result, I developed something I call the trunk model of genealogical data visualization. This radial model presents three distinct solutions to the issues posed by the traditional family tree.

                <p class=" case__description-body">The following is my first iteration for the web application Trunks, that uses the eponymous model in d3 to visualize some dynasties. I am using a color palette that is recommended by Colorbrewer 3.0, a colorblind-friendly and accessible palette generator. This iteration is the prototype one can view and work with live. While I am content with the model itself, the interface presented several issues that I am in the process of solving.

                <p class=" case__description-body">The following are projected solutions to the issues presented in first web app iteration. This interface is more visual and, by including previews of other family trees, prompts the viewer to explore them. In addition, the json structure allows me to pull more data and visualizations from it, and allow the user to view general statistics about the dynasty. Moreover, one can explore various branches of the family in depth.

                <p class=" case__description-body">In addition to refining and testing the second web application prototype with a group of users, I intend on making the site dynamic by feeding in an open database of family trees. There is currently no API that exists for that purpose, but I am in the process of developing a scraper for family trees that exist on places like Wikipedia and Wikia.
