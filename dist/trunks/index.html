        <h3 class="case__description-title">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">The tree model of genealogical data visualization is inherently flawed. Though
            user interviews, I identified the main issues faced by those analyzing family trees. After identifying the
            main issues, I set out to develop a graceful and user-centered solution. Trunks is the result of my mission.
            Through research about graph theory and with the use of the d3.js JavaScript library, I designed an
            open-source web application that visualizes familial bonds in the form of a sunburst chart, which resembles
            a chopped down trunk. </p>

            <h3 class="case__callout-title">Design Challenge</h3>
            <p class="case__callout-body">Develop a simple visualization method for genealogical data that presents
                ancestral relations concisely, thoroughly and in a usable manner.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="case__description-title">User Research</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">In order to optimize the visualization of familial relations, I set out to
            research and identify common shortcomings of the traditional tree model. I chose to interview classmates in
            my Cultural Anthropology course about a recent assignment that involved researching family trees and
            assessed their experience with deriving information from them. I interviewed 5 people for 15 minutes each
            and asked each interviewee to design the perfect family tree at the end of our conversation. I recorded my
            findings and drew conclusions at the end of the user interviews. <a class="u-sky">The full report
                can be found here.</a></p>

        <h3 class="case__description-title">Usability Issues with the Tree Model</h3>
        <p class="case__description-body">Three common issues kept being brought up: lack of scalability, visual
            verbosity and limited scope, with focus primarily skewed towards one ancestral branch. Below are the three
            main issues with brief explanations of each one.
        </p>
        <ul class="case__problems">
            <li class="case__problems--item">
                <h3 class="case__callout-title">Issue 1</h3>
                <p class="case__callout-body">Lack of Scalability
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="case__problems--item">
                <h3 class="case__callout-title">Issue 2</h3>
                <p class="case__callout-body">Visual Density
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="case__problems--item">
                <h3 class="case__callout-title">Issue 3</h3>
                <p class="case__callout-body">Limited Scope
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="case__description-body"> <em class="case__description--subhead">Lack of Scalability</em> The length
            and width of family trees are unpredictable and
            vary based on the data being mapped. When the ancestor has many siblings, the chart is primarily horizontal.
            On the other hand, when the ancestor has many descendants, the chart is primarily vertical. This variability
            is not accounted for when displaying charts in smaller viewport sizes, such as on a mobile screen. Even when
            viewed on a large screen, the window needs to scroll both vertically and horizontally, leading to poor user
            experience. Therefore, the tree model is outdated, not scalable or responsive and unsuited for the modern,
            digital user.
        </p>
        <p class="case__description-body"> <em class="case__description--subhead">Visual Density</em> The horizontally
            and vertically variable design does not give a concise summary of data to the user at first glance.
            Hierarchy is not effectively communicated and requires more thinking of the user’s part. Usable design must
            be effortless to comprehend.
        </p>
        <p class="case__description-body"> <em class="case__description--subhead">Limited Scope</em> Because of the
            dimensional limitations of the tree model, the chart can only display one
            branch at a time, resulting in a skewed chart. A simple flaw of design, unilaterality, results in the
            omission of data, which is intellectually dishonest and defeats the purpose of displaying data in the first
            place.

            <p class="img-pair__text case__description-body">I want to create a system that would allow for a beautiful
                visualization
                of a familial dynasty,
                historical, fictional or otherwise. Instead of following a rigid mathematical structure based on
                fractals, I would like to focus on aberrations in the family that make the fractal-like nature of a
                family tree imperfect, making it unique.Every one of my friends and their grandma knows that I am
